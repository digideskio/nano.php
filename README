The Nano Framework
By: Timothy Totten <2010@totten.ca>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nano is a PHP framework for building web applications.
It's meant to be smaller than a micro-framework, and is very flexible.

At it's core, is a set of classes for loading libraries, classes, object
instances and dynamic page content. There is no fixed method for using
these classes, but default patterns and extensions are found as Meta classes.

Meta classes for MVC-style applications are included, as well as for a
powerful and flexible URL-based controller dispatch system.

In addition, several simple base classes for controllers and models are
included, as well as a few simple helper libraries providing some useful
functions for your applications.

There are two versions of Nano included in this distribution.

Nano2 is the second generation of Nano, is object-oriented and handles
things using a global Nano object which can be retreived with a single
global function.

Nano3 is the third generation of Nano. It uses PHP Namespaces and a new
model for loading extensions. It also uses the SPL autoloader to make
loading classes easier.
