The Nano Framework Toolkit
----------------------------------

A PHP toolkit for building micro-frameworks.
This now contains two versions of Nano.

The lib/nano folder contains Nano v1. This version is deprecated
and will eventually be removed once I've ported any projects using it over
to v2. Nano v1 is based on a lot of "magic" code including "eval" statements
and plenty more. It also pollutes the global namespace with tons of
functions, variables and more.

The lib/nano2 folder contains Nano v2. This is the path forward for Nano.
It's object oriented and exports only two functions (get_php_content and
get_nano_instance), one global variable ($__nano__instance) and a bunch
of classes all with the Nano prefix (e.g. Nano, NanoException, NanoLoader, etc.)

The extensions and base classes provided with Nano v2 are also far simpler
and cleaner than the ones for v1.

Any projects using Nano v1 should be migrated to Nano v2. In some cases, it
may make sense to create wrapper methods, as large code-bases may have a lot
of calls to now non-existent global functions.

The Nano Framework is created by Timothy Totten.
