The Nano PHP Framework Toolkit
By: Timothy Totten <2010@totten.ca>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nano is a PHP toolkit for building web application frameworks.

The core library is a small object that loads plugins which give it
different abilities as required by your application needs.

Several extendable abstract classes for controllers and models are included, 
as well as a URL-based dispatch plugin, configuration plugin, and a set of
simple helper libraries providing some useful functions for your applications.

The current generation of Nano is Nano4, and it lives in the lib/nano4
folder. Nano3 can be found in the 'nano3' git branch.
