The Nano Framework
By: Timothy Totten <2010@totten.ca>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nano is a PHP framework for building web applications.
It's meant to be smaller than a micro-framework, and is very flexible.

At it's core, is a set of classes for loading libraries, classes, object
instances and dynamic page content. There is no fixed method for using
these classes, but default patterns and extensions are found as Meta classes.

Meta classes for MVC-style applications are included, as well as for a
powerful and flexible URL-based controller dispatch system.

In addition, several simple base classes for controllers and models are
included, as well as a few simple helper libraries providing some useful
functions for your applications.

The current generation of Nano is Nano3, and it lives in the lib/nano3
folder. Both previous generations of Nano have been discontinued.
